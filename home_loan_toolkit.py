    Most Indian banks don't support automatic bi-weekly EMI deductions. But don't worry - here's the workaround!
    </div>
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)

    st.markdown(f"""
    **Option 1: Manual Annual Prepayment (Easiest)**
    - Keep your regular monthly EMI of {format_inr(regular_emi)}
    - Once a year, make an additional prepayment of {format_inr(regular_emi)}
    - This mimics the 13th payment effect
    - Best time: March (before financial year ends for tax benefits)

    **Option 2: Semi-Annual Prepayment**
    - Every 6 months, prepay {format_inr(regular_emi/2)}
    - Twice a year = Same as 13th EMI
    - Easier to manage than annual lump sum

    **Option 3: True Bi-Weekly (if bank allows)**
    - Check if your bank supports bi-weekly auto-debit
    - Set up standing instruction for {format_inr(regular_emi/2)} every 2 weeks
    - Rare in India, but worth asking!

    **Pro Tips:**
    - ‚úÖ Ensure prepayments reduce tenure, not EMI
    - ‚úÖ Confirm zero prepayment charges (floating rate loans usually have nil)
    - ‚úÖ Keep prepayment receipts for tax filing
    - ‚úÖ Track principal paid for 80C benefit (max ‚Çπ1.5L/year)

    Extra principal paid qualifies for Section 80C. Get receipts and claim in ITR!<br><br>

    <strong>3. Forgetting about emergency fund</strong><br>

    **Step 1: Plan Ahead**
    - Track expected windfalls (bonus, tax refund, maturity proceeds)
    - Keep 3-month emergency fund before applying lump sum
    - Check bank's prepayment process (usually online now)

    **Step 2: Timing**
    - Apply before March 31 to claim 80C in current FY
    - Best months: December (before tax planning) or March (tax benefit)
    - Avoid applying in last 5 years of tenure (low impact)

    **Step 3: Documentation**
    - Request updated amortization schedule from bank
    - Keep prepayment receipt for ITR filing
    - Update insurance coverage if applicable

    **Pro Tips:**
    - Choose "reduce tenure" over "reduce EMI" for maximum savings
    - If lump sum > ‚Çπ1.5L, split across financial years for max 80C benefit
    - Some banks limit prepayment to 25% of outstanding per year - check first

    **OD Loan is BETTER if:**
    - ‚úÖ You have irregular income (freelancer, business owner)
    - ‚úÖ You maintain high bank balance (‚Çπ5L+)
    - ‚úÖ You're in NEW tax regime (no 80C benefit anyway)
    - ‚úÖ Interest savings > Tax savings lost
    - ‚úÖ You value liquidity (can withdraw when needed)

    **Regular Loan is BETTER if:**
    - ‚úÖ You're in OLD tax regime and max out 80C
    - ‚úÖ You have regular salaried income
    - ‚úÖ Your monthly surplus is low (<‚Çπ25K)
    - ‚úÖ You're disciplined about prepayment
    - ‚úÖ You want forced savings (prepayment is locked)

    **Pro Tip:**
    If you're in 30% bracket and OLD regime, you need ‚Çπ{SECTION_80C_LIMIT:,} annual surplus
    to lose ‚Çπ{SECTION_80C_LIMIT * 0.30:,.0f} in 80C benefit. Calculate if interest saved beats this!

    st.markdown("""
    **Step 1: Check Eligibility**
    - Not all banks offer OD loans for home purchase
    - Usually available for high-value properties (‚Çπ50L+)
    - SBI, HDFC, ICICI offer home loan OD variants

    **Step 2: Application**
    - Same process as regular home loan
    - May need higher processing fee
    - Interest rate: 0.25-0.50% higher than regular

    **Step 3: Usage**
    - Deposit entire salary into OD account
    - Withdraw for expenses throughout month
    - Interest calculated daily on net outstanding
    - No need to inform bank for deposits/withdrawals

    **Step 4: Discipline Required**
    - Don't treat it like a savings account
    - Maintain minimum balance = your target prepayment
    - Track interest saved monthly (bank provides statement)

    The bank calls, the documentation, the waiting - frustrating. But you know what?<br><br>

    That 0.75% saved me ‚Çπ4.2 lakhs over the remaining 17 years. That's my daughter's college fund.
    That's worth a few days of hassle!<br><br>

    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't transfer for 0.25% (hassle > savings). But for 0.50%+? DO IT.
    Future-you will thank present-you. I promise. üôè

    **Step 1: Check Eligibility**
    - Most banks offer top-up after 1 year of regular repayment
    - Typically up to 80% of current property value minus outstanding loan
    - Documentation: Similar to original loan

    **Step 2: Apply Strategically**
    - Best use: Home renovation (gets 24b tax benefit!)
    - Acceptable: Debt consolidation (no tax benefit but huge savings)
    - Avoid: Lifestyle expenses (defeats the purpose)

    **Step 3: Calculate Break-Even**
    - Processing fee: ~0.5% of top-up amount
    - Break-even: Usually 2-3 months
    - After that: Pure savings!

    **Pro Tips:**
    - Close credit cards after consolidation (avoid re-accumulating debt)
    - Set up auto-debit for discipline
    - Use saved interest to prepay home loan faster

    üíö <strong>The Debt Trap Escape:</strong><br><br>

    Credit card debt is a silent killer. 36-42% interest compounds so fast that you're running
    on a treadmill - paying EMI but never reducing principal.<br><br>

    I've seen people stuck in this cycle for YEARS. One friend was paying ‚Çπ15K/month on credit
    cards for 3 years and still owed ‚Çπ4L! The math didn't make sense until we calculated:
    Of that ‚Çπ15K, ‚Çπ12K was JUST INTEREST.<br><br>

    Top-up changed his life. Same ‚Çπ15K/month, but at 9% instead of 36%. Debt cleared in 4 years
    instead of never. He's now saving for his kid's education.<br><br>

    If you're in debt - ANY debt above 12% - seriously consider this. It's not sexy, but it works.

    üíö <strong>The Most Personal Decision You'll Ever Make:</strong><br><br>

    I rented for 8 years. Moved 5 times. Different landlords, different rules, different headaches.
    Every time I wanted to hang a picture, I had to ask permission. My daughter couldn't paint
    her room pink. We couldn't get a dog.<br><br>

    When I finally bought my home in 2018, my daughter (then 7) asked: "Papa, is this REALLY ours?
    Forever?" That question still makes me emotional.<br><br>

    But here's the thing - my college friend still rents. He's built a ‚Çπ1.5 crore investment
    portfolio with the money he saved. He travels the world. Zero EMI stress. Zero maintenance
    headaches. He's HAPPY.<br><br>

    <strong>The Truth?</strong> There's no right answer. The "best" choice is the one that lets
    YOU sleep peacefully at night.<br><br>

    <strong>Buy if:</strong> You crave stability, roots, a place to call home. If the thought
    of owning your walls makes you smile. If you want to leave something tangible for your kids.<br><br>

    <strong>Rent if:</strong> You value flexibility, travel, career mobility. If you're better at
    investing than real estate. If EMI stress keeps you awake at night.<br><br>

    Both my paths led to happiness. Choose yours. Don't let society decide for you. üè†‚ù§Ô∏è

    üíö <strong>The Day I Became Debt-Free:</strong><br><br>

    June 15, 2023. I had ‚Çπ18 lakhs in savings. My loan outstanding was ‚Çπ16 lakhs. I was 42.
    <br><br>

    My financial advisor said: "Don't close it. Your loan is at 7.5%. Invest the ‚Çπ18L in
    debt mutual funds at 9%. You'll make ‚Çπ2.7L extra over 10 years."<br><br>

    The math was right. But I closed it anyway.<br><br>

    You know why? Because for 12 years, EVERY SINGLE MONTH, that EMI hung over my head.
    Family vacation? "Can we afford it with the EMI?" Job offer in another city? "But
    the EMI..." Daughter's college fund? "After the EMI..."<br><br>

    The day I closed it, I slept for 10 hours straight. First time in 12 years. My wife
    cried happy tears. My daughter (then 16) said, "Papa, you look younger!"<br><br>

    Did I miss out on ‚Çπ2.7L? Maybe. Do I regret it? NOT FOR A SECOND.<br><br>

    <strong>Here's what no calculator shows:</strong><br>
    ‚Ä¢ The weight that lifts off your shoulders<br>
    ‚Ä¢ The confidence in job negotiations (no EMI pressure)<br>
    ‚Ä¢ The freedom to take career risks<br>
    ‚Ä¢ The joy of "This is OUR house, fully paid!"<br>
    ‚Ä¢ The pride of telling your kids "We're debt-free"<br><br>

    <strong>But my friend Rahul?</strong> He kept his loan, invested his ‚Çπ25L windfall in 2019.
    Today it's ‚Çπ52L. He'll close his loan in 2026 and STILL have ‚Çπ20L left. He's also happy!<br><br>

    <strong>The lesson?</strong> Financial freedom means different things to different people.
    For me, it meant zero debt. For Rahul, it means maximum wealth.<br><br>

        st.markdown("""
        **Step 1: Get Competing Quotes (3 banks minimum)**
        - Don't just ask for rates online
        - Visit branch, talk to loan officer
        - Get formal quote in writing (or email)

        **Step 2: Leverage Your Profile**

        Things banks LOVE:
        - ‚úÖ High credit score (750+)
        - ‚úÖ Stable job (3+ years in current company)
        - ‚úÖ Higher down payment (30%+)
        - ‚úÖ Existing relationship (salary account, credit card)
        - ‚úÖ Professional qualifications (CA, Doctor, Engineer, etc.)

        **Step 3: The Negotiation Script**

        *"I'm comparing offers from HDFC, SBI, and ICICI. HDFC offered me 8.40% with 0.25% processing fee.
        I prefer your bank because [genuine reason], but I need you to match or beat that rate.
        Can you do 8.35% or waive the processing fee?"*

        **Why this works:**
        - You're not being aggressive, just practical
        - You're showing you've done homework
        - You're giving them a target to beat
        - You're expressing preference (makes them want your business)

        **Step 4: Timing is Everything**

        Best times to negotiate:
        - üìÖ End of month (targets pressure)
        - üìÖ End of quarter (March, June, Sept, Dec)
        - üìÖ Festival seasons (Diwali, New Year offers)
        - üìÖ Bank anniversary months

        **Step 5: What's Actually Negotiable**

        ‚úÖ Interest rate: 0.10-0.50% possible
        ‚úÖ Processing fee: Can get 50% off or waived
        ‚úÖ Technical/legal charges: Often waived
        ‚ùå Stamp duty & registration: Government fees, non-negotiable

        **Real Example:**
        - Bank's initial offer: 8.60% + 0.50% processing fee
        - After negotiation: 8.45% + 0.25% processing fee
        - Savings: ‚Çπ4-5 lakhs over 20 years!

        **1. Processing Fee**
        - Typical: 0.25-0.50% of loan amount + 18% GST
        - On ‚Çπ40L loan: ‚Çπ10,000-20,000 + GST = ‚Çπ12,000-24,000
        - Often negotiable! Ask for waiver or 50% off

        **2. Login Fees / Administration Charges**
        - Some banks: ‚Çπ5,000-10,000 one-time
        - For what? Nobody knows üòÖ
        - Try to get this waived

        **3. Technical & Legal Fees**
        - Property valuation: ‚Çπ3,000-5,000
        - Legal verification: ‚Çπ5,000-8,000
        - Sometimes bundled, sometimes separate
        - Sometimes waived for "premium" customers

        **4. Stamp Duty & Registration**
        - **BIGGEST COST** after down payment
        - 5-7% of property value (varies by state)
        - Maharashtra: 5%, Karnataka: 5%, UP: 7%
        - On ‚Çπ50L property: ‚Çπ2.5-3.5 lakhs!
        - **Pro tip:** Register in wife's name (1-2% discount in many states)

        **5. Pre-EMI Interest** (for under-construction)
        - If buying under-construction property
        - You pay ONLY interest until possession
        - Can add up to several lakhs
        - Factor this into your budget!

        **6. Insurance**
        - Banks push home loan insurance
        - Typical: ‚Çπ10,000-20,000 per year
        - **You can say NO** (for floating rate loans)
        - Or buy cheaper term insurance separately

        **7. Prepayment Charges** (Read fine print!)
        - Floating rate: Usually NIL
        - Fixed rate: Often 2-4%!
        - This is why floating rate is preferred

        **Total Hidden Costs Example:**
        - Processing: ‚Çπ15,000
        - Login: ‚Çπ5,000
        - Technical/Legal: ‚Çπ8,000
        - Stamp duty: ‚Çπ3,00,000

        **The Golden Rule: Prepay in first 5 years for maximum impact**

        **Why first 5 years?**
        - In early years, 70-80% of EMI is INTEREST
        - Later years, 70-80% is principal
        - Every‚Çπ1 prepaid in Year 1 saves ‚Çπ2.50 in interest
        - Same ‚Çπ1 in Year 15 saves only ‚Çπ0.30

        **When TO Prepay:**
        ‚úÖ After receiving bonus
        ‚úÖ Tax refund received
        ‚úÖ Inherited money
        ‚úÖ When interest rates are falling (prepay before rate cut)
        ‚úÖ March (before financial year end for tax benefit)

        **When NOT to Prepay:**
        ‚ùå If you have higher-interest debt (credit card, personal loan)
        ‚ùå If you have zero emergency fund
        ‚ùå If you can invest elsewhere at 10-12% post-tax
        ‚ùå If property prices are falling (invest in another property instead)
        ‚ùå In last 5 years of loan (minimal impact)

        **How Much to Prepay:**

        Minimum: Whatever you can spare
        Optimal: ‚Çπ1-2 lakhs per year
        Maximum: Keep 6 months emergency fund before prepaying aggressively

        **Prepayment Options:**

        When you prepay, bank asks: Reduce tenure or EMI?

        **Option A: Reduce Tenure** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
        - Same EMI continues
        - Loan closes earlier

    - "Will I be paying this for 20 years?"

        **The 40% Rule for Peace of Mind**

        EMI should NEVER exceed 40% of take-home salary

        - 20-25%: **Comfortable** - You can save, invest, enjoy life
        - 30-35%: **Manageable** - Tight but doable
        - 40-45%: **Stressful** - Think twice
        - 50%+: **Dangerous** - Lifestyle squeeze, one emergency away from default

        **Mental Accounting Trick**

        Don't think of EMI as "throwing money away"

        Think of it as: "Paying rent to future-me"

        - Interest component = Rent for using bank's money
        - Principal component = Savings in your own property

        Track the principal component - it grows every month! That's YOUR money building YOUR asset.

        **Milestone Approach** (Gamify Your Loan!)

        Celebrate these milestones:

        - üéâ Year 2: Crossed ‚Çπ2L principal paid
        - üéâ Year 5: 20% loan paid off
        - üéâ Year 10: HALFWAY DONE! Big celebration!
        - üéâ Year 15: 70% paid (tipping point - principal now exceeds interest)
        - üéâ Final Payment: FREEDOM DAY!

        **Visualization Exercise**

        1. Print your amortization schedule
        2. Highlight when principal exceeds interest (usually year 12-15)
        3. Mark off each completed year
        4. See the outstanding balance shrinking
        5. **Feel the progress!**

        **The "5 Years Forward" Perspective**

        Feeling overwhelmed by 20 years?

        Don't think 20 years ahead. Think 5 years ahead.

        In 5 years:
        - Your salary will likely double
        - EMI will feel much smaller
        - You'll have prepaid ‚Çπ5-10L (if smart)
        - Loan will seem manageable

        **1. Buying Based on Max Approved Amount**

        Bank approves ‚Çπ80L ‚Üí DON'T buy ‚Çπ80L property!

        Bank's job: Lend maximum
        Your job: Borrow smartly

        **Rule:** Buy 20-25% below max approved amount

        **2. Ignoring Maintenance Costs**

        Property cost ‚â† Total cost of ownership

        - Apartment: ‚Çπ3-5K/month (maintenance, repairs)
        - Villa: ‚Çπ5-10K/month
        - Society charges: ‚Çπ2-4K/month
        - Property tax: Annual

        **These add up to ‚Çπ5-10K/month extra!**

        **3. Not Reading Fine Print**

        - "Floating rate": Can increase (it has, multiple times)
        - "Subvention scheme": Builder pays interest during construction (but adds to cost)
        - "Possession date": Delays are common (keep renting for 6 months buffer)
        - "Prepayment allowed": Check frequency limits

        **4. Over-Leveraging on Future Income**

        "I'll get 10% increment every year"
        "My spouse will start working"
        "I'll get promoted"

        Reality:
        - Layoffs happen
        - Companies fail
        - Job switches mean salary resets
        - Spouse's career may not pan out

        **Plan EMI based on CURRENT income, not future dreams**

        **5. Skipping Emergency Fund**

        Home loan ‚â† Permission to empty savings account

        Before aggressive prepayment, maintain:
        - 6 months living expenses in liquid fund
        - 6 months EMI amount separate
        - ‚Çπ2-3L for home repairs/furnishing

        **6. Buying Under-Construction Without Research**

        Builder promises 2-year delivery ‚Üí Often becomes 4-5 years

        **What happens:**
        - You pay rent + pre-EMI (double whammy)
        - Costs add up
        - Mental stress

        **Due diligence:**
        - Check builder's track record
        - Visit previous projects
        - Check RERA registration
        - Talk to existing customers

        **7. Ignoring Location Growth Potential**

        ‚Çπ50L in developing area vs ‚Çπ50L in established area

        Consider:
        - Will metro/highway come nearby? (10-15% appreciation)
        - Are companies setting up offices? (Employment = demand)
        - School, hospital, mall coming up?

        **Location > Property size/features**

        **8. Not Comparing Multiple Banks**

        First bank you visit might not be the best

        0.5% rate difference = ‚Çπ4-5 lakhs over 20 years!

        **Visit minimum 3 banks, compare:**
        - Interest rate
        - Processing fee
        - Prepayment flexibility
        - Online servicing

        **9. Buying Too Early in Career**

        Age 23-25, just got first job ‚Üí Buying home? Maybe wait.

        Why:
        - Job stability unknown
        - May need to relocate
        - Salary will jump significantly in 3-5 years
        - Can get better property later

        **Ideal age: 28-35** (unless special circumstances)

        **10. Not Using Professional Help**

        "I'll handle it myself" ‚Üí Misses tax benefits, negotiation leverage, legal issues

        **Worth hiring:**
        - Property lawyer (‚Çπ10-15K): Can save lakhs in legal issues
        - Financial advisor (‚Çπ5-10K): Tax optimization alone recovers fee
        - Property inspector (‚Çπ5K): Finds structural issues before purchase

        <div class="danger-box">
        üíî <strong>The Biggest Mistake of All:</strong><br><br>

        **Buying because "everyone else is buying"**<br>
