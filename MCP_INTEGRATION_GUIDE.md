## üìã Step-by-Step Integration

### Phase 1: Setup Payment Gateway (Razorpay)

**Step 1: Create Payment Link Template**
```
Create a Razorpay payment link for ‚Çπ99 with:
- Title: "Home Loan Toolkit - Premium Access"
- Description: "Unlock all 12 strategies + calculators + lifetime access"
- Accept UPI, Cards, NetBanking, Wallets
- Send receipt to customer email
- Callback URL: https://home-loan-toolkit.onrender.com/payment-success
```

**Step 2: Integrate into Streamlit App**

Update `home_loan_toolkit.py` checkout page (line 1094-1106):

```python
# Replace the payment button section with:
if st.button("üí≥ Proceed to Secure Payment", use_container_width=True, type="primary"):
    # User email from session state
    user_email = st.session_state.get('user_email', '')

    if user_email:
        # Ask Claude to create payment link via MCP
        st.info(f"""
        Creating secure payment link for {user_email}...

        Use Claude Code MCP to execute:
        "Create a Razorpay payment link for ‚Çπ99 with email {user_email}
        and send notification"
        """)
    else:
        st.warning("Please enter your email address first")
```

**Step 3: Handle Payment Success**

Create a webhook handler or callback page to mark users as paid.

### Phase 2: Deploy to Render

**Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**
```
Create a GitHub repository for the home loan toolkit and push the code
```

**Step 2: Prepare for Deployment**

Create `requirements.txt`:
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
plotly>=5.17.0
```

Create `render.yaml` (optional):
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: home-loan-toolkit
    runtime: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: streamlit run home_loan_toolkit.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0
    envVars:
      - key: PYTHON_VERSION
        value: 3.11.0
```

**Step 3: Deploy via MCP**
```
Deploy a new Streamlit web service on Render named "home-loan-toolkit"
from my GitHub repository with Python 3.11
and start command "streamlit run home_loan_toolkit.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0"
```

**Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)**
```
Set up custom domain home-loan-toolkit.com for my service
```

### Phase 3: Production Monitoring

**Daily Health Check:**
```
Show me today's traffic, errors, and performance metrics for home-loan-toolkit
```

**Payment Monitoring:**
```
List all payments from the last 24 hours with status "captured"
```

**User Analytics:**
```
How many payment links were created this week?
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **API Keys**
   - ‚úÖ Stored in `API_KEYS.md` (gitignored)
   - ‚úÖ Never commit to version control
   - ‚úÖ Use live keys only for production
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider test/sandbox keys for development

2. **Payment Verification**
   - Always verify payment status server-side
   - Use webhook signatures to validate callbacks
   - Never trust client-side payment confirmations

3. **Render Security**
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Enable HTTPS (automatic on Render)
   - Implement rate limiting for payment endpoints

4. **User Data**
   - Store minimal user data
   - Comply with payment card industry standards
   - Use Razorpay's hosted checkout for PCI compliance
