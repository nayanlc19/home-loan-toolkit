## üìä Example Scenario

**Borrowing Requirement**: ‚Çπ1,00,000 for 12 months

### Personal Loan (HDFC @ 10.50%)
- Monthly EMI: ‚Çπ8,840
- Total Interest: ‚Çπ6,080
- Processing Fee: ‚Çπ2,360
- **Total Cost: ‚Çπ8,440**

### Overdraft Against Salary (ICICI @ 13.86%)
- Average Utilization: 50% (‚Çπ50,000)
- Days Used: 15/month
- Monthly Interest: ‚Çπ854
- **Total Cost: ‚Çπ10,548**
- **But**: Only if you use 50% for 15 days/month

### Overdraft Against FD (ICICI)
- OD Rate: 8.60% (6.60% FD + 2%)
- FD Interest Earned: ‚Çπ7,260
- OD Interest Paid: ‚Çπ1,672
- **Net Cost: -‚Çπ5,588** (You actually earn!)

## üö® Reality Check: Why Overdraft Can Be Cheaper Despite Higher Rates

### The Math Marketing Doesn't Show

**Personal Loan**: Interest charged on **‚Çπ1,00,000 √ó 30 days √ó 12 months**

**Overdraft**: Interest charged on **‚Çπ50,000 √ó 15 days √ó 12 months** (if 50% utilized for 15 days)

This is why an overdraft at 14% can cost LESS than a loan at 10.5%!

### The Catches

1. **Only if you don't use full limit**: At 100% utilization for 30 days, overdraft becomes expensive
2. **Renewal fees add up**: ‚Çπ250-‚Çπ500 annually
3. **Requires discipline**: Easy to over-utilize
4. **Variable interest**: Some banks have floating rates

## üéì When to Choose What

### Choose Personal Loan If:
- ‚úÖ You need the **full amount immediately**
- ‚úÖ You want **fixed, predictable EMIs**
- ‚úÖ You'll use **90-100%** of borrowed amount
- ‚úÖ You prefer **longer tenure** (24-60 months)
- ‚úÖ You value **simplicity** over flexibility
- ‚úÖ You're from Jan 2026 onwards (0% prepayment charges)

### Choose Overdraft If:
- ‚úÖ Your need is **variable** or uncertain
- ‚úÖ You'll use only **30-70%** of limit on average
- ‚úÖ You need funds for **short, intermittent periods**
- ‚úÖ You want **flexibility** in withdrawals/repayments
- ‚úÖ You can **repay quickly** when you have surplus
- ‚úÖ You have **FD for collateral** (lowest effective cost)

## üè¶ Key Differences

| Feature | Personal Loan | Overdraft |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Interest Calculation** | Entire amount from day 1 | Only on utilized amount, daily |
| **Interest Rate** | 10% - 20% p.a. | 13% - 15% p.a. |
| **Processing Fee** | 1.5% - 3.5% + GST | 0% - 1% |
| **Disbursement** | 1-7 days | Instant (if limit approved) |
| **Repayment** | Fixed EMI only | Very flexible |
| **Prepayment** | 0% - 6% (0% from Jan 2026) | None |
| **Best For** | Full amount needed | Variable/short-term needs |

## üìÖ Important RBI Update (July 2025)

**From January 1, 2026**, RBI mandates:
- **Zero prepayment/foreclosure charges** on personal loans for individual borrowers
- Applies to both floating AND fixed rate loans
- Applies even if there's a co-borrower

This makes personal loans more attractive for those who might want to close early!

## üî¨ Calculation Methodology

### Personal Loan EMI Formula
```
EMI = P √ó r √ó (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)

Where:
P = Principal amount
r = Monthly interest rate (Annual rate / 12 / 100)
n = Tenure in months
```

### Overdraft Interest Calculation
```
Monthly Interest = Utilized Amount √ó (Annual Rate / 365) √ó Days Used

Total Cost = Sum of Monthly Interest + Processing Fee + Renewal Fees
```

### Overdraft Against FD Net Cost
```
OD Interest = Utilized Amount √ó ((FD Rate + Spread) / 365) √ó Days Used
FD Interest Earned = FD Amount √ó (FD Rate / 100) √ó (Tenure / 12)

Net Cost = Total OD Interest - FD Interest Earned + Processing Fee
```
