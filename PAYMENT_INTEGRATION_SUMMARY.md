## 🔄 How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **Landing Page**
   - User enters email address
   - System checks if admin or paid user

2. **Checkout Page**
   - User clicks "Proceed to Secure Payment"
   - System creates personalized Razorpay payment link
   - User clicks payment button → Redirected to Razorpay

3. **Payment on Razorpay**
   - User pays ₹99 via UPI/Card/NetBanking
   - Razorpay processes payment
   - User redirected back to website

4. **After Payment**
   - User refreshes page
   - Email checked against paid_users.json
   - Access granted automatically

### Admin Flow:
- Admin emails bypass payment
- Automatic access to all features

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Before Deploying:

1. **Test Locally First:**
   ```bash
   cd /d/Claude/Projects/Financial_Apps
   streamlit run home_loan_toolkit.py
   ```
   - Test email entry
   - Test checkout flow
   - Test payment link generation

2. **Prepare for Render:**
   - Ensure all files are saved
   - Commit changes to git (if using)

### Deploy to Render:

**IMPORTANT:** You need to add environment variables to Render:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find your service: `home-loan-toolkit`
3. Go to **Environment** section
4. Add these environment variables (get actual values from D:\Claude\API_KEYS.md):

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<from API_KEYS.md>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<from API_KEYS.md>
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<from API_KEYS.md>
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<from API_KEYS.md>
APP_URL=https://home-loan-toolkit.onrender.com
PAYMENT_AMOUNT=9900
PAYMENT_CURRENCY=INR
```

5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Render will automatically redeploy with new environment variables

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Payment Verification (Manual Step Required)

**CRITICAL:** The current implementation creates payment links but does NOT automatically verify payments. Here's why:

1. **Payment Link Created:** ✅ Working
2. **User Pays on Razorpay:** ✅ Working
3. **Automatic Verification:** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

**What happens now:**
- User pays ₹99
- Payment successful on Razorpay
- **You need to manually add their email to `paid_users.json`**

**How to add paid users manually:**
Edit `paid_users.json`:
```json
{
  "paid_users": [
    "customer1@example.com",
    "customer2@gmail.com"
  ],
  "payments": [
    {
      "email": "customer1@example.com",
      "payment_id": "pay_xxxxx",
      "amount": 9900,
      "currency": "INR",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-28T12:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### To Implement Automatic Verification (Future):

You need to set up **Razorpay Webhooks**:
1. Go to Razorpay Dashboard → Settings → Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://home-loan-toolkit.onrender.com/webhook`
3. Create a new `/webhook` endpoint in your app
4. Verify payment signature
5. Automatically add email to `paid_users.json`

**For now:** Check Razorpay dashboard daily and manually add paid users.

4. **Email Notifications** - Send confirmation emails after payment
5. **Payment History** - Show payment history to admins
6. **Refund Support** - Add refund request handling
