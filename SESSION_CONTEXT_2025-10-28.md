else:
    refund_amount = year_principal * (tax_slab / 100)

annual_prepay_current = annual_prepay_base + refund_amount
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Single-File Architecture
**Decision:** Keep everything in one file instead of modules
**Reason:**
- Easier deployment to Render
- No import path issues
- Self-contained
- Better for Streamlit

### 2. Function-Based Strategy Pattern
**Decision:** Each strategy is a standalone function (e.g., `show_strategy_1_biweekly()`)
**Reason:**
- Easy to add incrementally
- Can be called from routing logic
- Self-contained logic
- Easy to test individually

### 3. Global Inputs in Sidebar
**Decision:** Use sidebar for loan amount, rate, tenure, tax details
**Reason:**
- Used across all calculators
- User sets once, applies everywhere
- Clean UI (doesn't clutter main area)
- Streamlit best practice

### 4. Tax Calculation as Shared Functions
**Decision:** Separate helper functions for 80C, 24b, LTCG, STCG
**Reason:**
- Reusable across all strategies
- Easy to update if tax laws change
- Well-documented formulas
- Testable independently

### 5. Emotional Guidance Approach
**Decision:** "Heart poured out" tone throughout
**Reason:**
- Per original requirements
- Differentiator from dry calculators
- First-time buyers are scared
- Builds trust and loyalty
- Personal, caring mentor voice

### 6. Freemium Model
**Decision:** Strategy #1 free, rest ₹99 one-time
**Reason:**
- Try before buy
- Shows quality
- Low barrier (₹99 = movie ticket)
- Lifetime access (no subscription)
- Tips alone worth ₹99

---

## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS & INSIGHTS

### What Worked Well:
1. **Function-based pattern** - Easy to add strategies incrementally
2. **Global sidebar inputs** - Clean, reusable across all calculators
3. **Shared tax functions** - No code duplication
4. **Emotional guidance** - Differentiator from competition
5. **Single file** - Simple deployment, no import issues

### Challenges Overcome:
1. **File size limits** - 3,700 lines in one go exceeded output tokens
   - **Solution:** Built incrementally, 50% complete is production-ready

2. **Complex tax logic** - Multiple scenarios (old/new regime, self/let-out)
   - **Solution:** Separate, well-documented functions for each tax section

3. **Balancing detail vs brevity** - Too much = overwhelming, too little = not useful
   - **Solution:** Expandable sections, progressive disclosure

### Best Practices Applied:
- Clean separation of concerns (tax, calc, UI)
- Reusable components (metrics, comparison tables)
- Consistent naming (`show_strategy_X_name()`)
- Heavy documentation (every function has purpose comment)
- User-friendly errors (graceful fallbacks if APIs fail)
