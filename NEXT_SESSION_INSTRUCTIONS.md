    """Section 24(b) - Interest deduction (â‚¹2L self-occupied, unlimited let-out)"""

def calculate_ltcg_tax(gains, investment_type="equity"):
    """Long-term capital gains (10% above â‚¹1.25L for equity)"""

interest_rate = st.sidebar.number_input("Interest Rate (%)", ...)
tenure_years = st.sidebar.slider("Tenure (Years)", 5, 30, 20)

# Tax configuration (CRITICAL)
tax_slab = st.sidebar.selectbox("Tax Slab (%)", [0, 20, 30], index=2)
tax_regime = st.sidebar.radio("Tax Regime", ["Old (with deductions)", "New (no deductions)"])
property_type = st.sidebar.radio("Property Type", ["Self-Occupied", "Let-Out"])
```

## ðŸš« WHAT NOT TO DO

1. **Don't skip tax calculations** - User specifically asked for this
2. **Don't make calculators without real logic** - No placeholders
3. **Don't forget the "heart" part** - This is for scared first-time buyers
4. **Don't ignore the backup files** - They have proven tax logic
5. **Don't break OAuth/payment** - Keep that working

---

## ðŸ“‹ STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH

### Step 1: Read Design Document (5 min)
Open `COMPREHENSIVE_TOOLKIT_DESIGN.md` and understand the structure.

### Step 2: Extract Key Functions (15 min)
From `home_loan_comparison_app.py`:
- Tax calculation functions
- OD loan calculator
- Amortization logic

### Step 3: Build Tax Module (30 min)
Create the shared tax calculation functions that all strategies will use.

### Step 4: Build Strategy by Strategy (3-4 hours)
Start with Strategy #2 (Tax Refund Amplification) since #1 exists.
For each:
- Calculator logic
- Tax impact
- Tips section
Test as you go.

### Step 5: Add Tips & Tricks Content (1 hour)
Write the heart-poured guidance sections.

### Step 6: Add Bank Comparison (30 min)
Simple table with current rates.

### Step 7: Test Everything (30 min)
- Test all calculations with sample inputs
- Verify tax logic is correct
- Check OAuth and payment still work

### Step 8: Deploy (10 min)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete comprehensive toolkit with all strategies, tax, and guidance"
git push
# Render auto-deploys
```

## ðŸ’¡ CRITICAL TAX FORMULAS

### Section 80C (Principal Repayment)
```python
# Only available in OLD tax regime
# Max â‚¹1.5L per year
eligible_amount = min(principal_paid_in_year, 150000)
tax_saved = eligible_amount * (tax_slab / 100)

# If new regime: tax_saved = 0
```

### Section 24(b) (Interest Deduction)
```python
# Available in both old and new regime
# Self-occupied: Max â‚¹2L per year
# Let-out: Unlimited

if property_type == "Self-Occupied":
    eligible_amount = min(interest_paid_in_year, 200000)
else:  # Let-out
    eligible_amount = interest_paid_in_year

tax_saved = eligible_amount * (tax_slab / 100)
```

### LTCG (Long-term Capital Gains)
```python
# Equity mutual funds/stocks held > 1 year
# â‚¹1.25L exemption, then 10% tax

taxable_gains = max(0, total_gains - 125000)
ltcg_tax = taxable_gains * 0.10
```

### STCG (Short-term Capital Gains)
```python
# Equity: Flat 15%
# Debt: At income tax slab rate

if asset_type == "equity":
    stcg_tax = gains * 0.15
else:  # debt
    stcg_tax = gains * (tax_slab / 100)
```

4. **Tax visibility** - Always show "Pre-tax" vs "Post-tax" savings
5. **Winner declarations** - In comparison calculators (SIP vs Prepay, etc.)
